This has catalyzed the enhanced desire of real-time ML, which therefore requires effective data pipeline that involves data pre-processing, feature selection, and model assessment. This is a system that integrates Models for automated data pipeline; this optimizes the ML process, reduces the chances of human error, and enhance predictive models’ accuracy. Developed with Python, the Scikit-learn library and Streamlit, the system allows for data uploading, data preprocessing, feature selection choice and models’ assessment. Also, presented results confirm higher effectiveness and availability to a larger number of users of the resulting products. Though there are some limitations like compatibility issues with the datasets, computation time and memory etc, the future augmentations based on deep learning, real-time data streaming along with the use of cloud environment for deployment will improve the prospects of automation in ML.
